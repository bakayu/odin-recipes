    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two
        9-inch round cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking
        powder, and salt in a bowl.
      </li>

      </div>
      <li>
        Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an electric
        mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.
      </li>

      </div>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers
        comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing
        from pans to cool completely.
      </li>
      <div class="img-cont">
        <img src="../media/step5.webp" alt="" class="img-cont2" />
      </div>
      <li>
        While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer
        until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa
        alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth spreading
        consistency.
      </li>
      <div class="img-cont">
        <img src="../media/step6.webp" alt="" class="img-cont2" />
      </div>
      <li>
        Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each
        layer with frosting, then stack them onto a serving plate.
      </li>
