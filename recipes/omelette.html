      Indian omelette (or masala omelette) is a popular Indian dish available in
      every Indian food stall around Malaysia. Very easy and fast to make, for
      breakfast or as a side dish. This unfolded omelette with crispy, bronzed
      edges and a soft middle is so delicious even on its own.
